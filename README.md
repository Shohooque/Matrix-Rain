In this project, **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts are employed to enhance code organization, reusability, and maintainability. By defining classes as blueprints, we encapsulate related data and methods, promoting modularity. **Encapsulation** restricts direct access to object data, ensuring data integrity. **Abstraction** simplifies complex systems by exposing only essential features, reducing programming complexity. **Inheritance** enables new classes to inherit properties and behaviors from existing ones, fostering code reuse and reducing redundancy. **Polymorphism** allows objects of different classes to be treated uniformly based on shared interfaces, enhancing flexibility and integration. These OOP principles collectively streamline development, making the codebase more robust, scalable, and easier to manage.
